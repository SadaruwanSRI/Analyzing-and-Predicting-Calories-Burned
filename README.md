# Workout Calories Prediction Using Regression Models

This project explores the use of linear and polynomial regression models to predict calories burned during workouts. The goal is to analyze the performance of these models and determine which one provides the most accurate predictions. The best model is then deployed through a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input workout data and get real-time predictions.

## Features

- **Model Comparison**: Linear and polynomial regression models are compared based on their predictive accuracy using test data.
- **Prediction Accuracy**: The models' performance is evaluated using R-squared values to measure how well they fit the data.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A user-friendly GUI is developed to allow easy input of workout data and generate calorie predictions instantly.
